          <h3>What is Copyright</h3>
          <p>
            Copyright is among the three types of legal and intellectual
            property sphere known as “intellectual properties.” Among patents,
            trademarks, and copyrights, the latter affects more individuals
            directly and personally than perhaps the fields of patents and
            trademarks combined. Patents involve inventions and processes;
            trademarks involve trade names, logos, brands, and configurations
            that are associated with business and commerce. Copyright uniquely
            deals with the subject matter of creative authorship in a fixed
            medium of expression, such as books, photos, print art, moving art,
            sound recordings, architectural works, and other such matters.
            <br />
            The essential copyright law within the United States is codified at
            Title 17 of the U. S. Code, from sections 101 and forward. The law
            protects authors and owners of “original works of authorship,” that
            are “fixed in a tangible medium of expression” including literary,
            dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works.
            This protection is available to both published and unpublished
            works. The Copyright Act confers upon lawful owners the exclusive
            rights to do the following with their works —
            <ul>
              <li>reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords</li>
              <li>prepare derivative works based upon the work</li>
              <li>
                distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by
                sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
                lending
              </li>
              <li>
                perform the work publicly, in the case of literary, musical,
                dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion
                pictures and other audio-visual works
              </li>
              <li>
                display the work publicly, in the case of literary, musical,
                dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial,
                graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of
                a motion picture or other audiovisual work
              </li>
              <li>
                perform the work publicly (in the case of sound recordings*) by
                means of a digital audio transmission
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            In addition, certain authors of works of visual art (such as photos)
            have the rights of attribution and integrity as described in section
            106A of the 1976 Copyright Act. These are also known as “moral
            rights” of authors.

          <h3>Who Can Claim Copyright?</h3>
          <p>
            Copyright protection arises naturally and automatically when a work
            of authorship is created in fixed medium of expression. In other
            words, once you snap a picture, or write a book, or finish a musical
            score, or create a new house architectural plans, you are the
            “author” of a copyright.
            <br />
            If however the work in question was made for hire, i.e., by someone
            who has hired you for that purpose, then the employer and not you is
            considered to be the author. Under the U.S. Copyright Act (Section
            101) a “work made for hire” means:
            <ul>
              <li>
                A work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her
                employment; or
              </li>
              <li>A work specially ordered or commissioned for use as:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>a contribution to a collective work</li>
                <li>a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work</li>
                <li>a translation</li>
                <li>a supplementary work</li>
                <li>a compilation</li>
                <li>an instructional text</li>
                <li>a test</li>
                <li>answer material for a test</li>
                <li>an atlas</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <br />
            The authors of a joint work are co-owners of the copyright in the
            work, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
            <br />
            Copyright in each separate contribution to a periodical or other
            collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as
            a whole and bests initially with the author of the contribution.
            <br />
            Again, we do not provide legal advice and cannot advise whether your
            work of authorship is, in reality, a work for hire or independent
            creation or joint creation. That must be decided by you and anyone
            else involved in the creative process. This is often the focal point
            of litigation and contention.

          <h3>Physical Ownership</h3>
          <p>
            Ownership of a book, manuscript, painting, or any other copy or
            phonorecord does not give the possessor any legal copyright. The law
            provides that transfer of ownership of any material object that
            embodies a protected work does not of itself convey any rights in
            the copyright.
          </p>
          <h3>Rights of Underage Minors</h3>
          <p>
            Minors are those persons who are generally defined by the state in
            which they reside as being of under age, and legally incapable of
            entering into binding contracts. In many states age of maturity is
            18 so anyone who has not reached his or her 18th birthday will be
            considered a minor. Minors may claim copyright, but state laws may
            regulate the business dealings involving copyrights owned by minors.
            <br />
            If a minor has taken a series of photographs or has written music
            which is desired by producers or commercial exploiters, a contract
            with a minor is likely to encounter “legal difficulty” without
            authorization of a parent or legal guardian who may properly provide
            the consent required by law.

          <h3>Foreigners’ Rights</h3>
          <p>
            American Copyright protection is available for all unpublished
            works, regardless of the nationality or domicile of the author.
            <br />
            Published works are eligible for copyright protection in the United
            States if any one of the following conditions is met:
            <ul>
              <li>
                On the date of first publication, one or more of the authors is
                a national or domiciliary of the United States, or is a
                national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a treaty
                party,* or is a stateless person wherever that person may be
                domiciled; or
              </li>
              <li>
                The work is first published in the United States or in a foreign
                nation that, on the date of first publication, is a treaty
                party. For purposes of this condition, a work that is published
                in the United States or a treaty party within 30 days after
                publication in a foreign nation that is not a treaty party shall
                be considered to be first published in the United States or such
                treaty party, as the case may be; or
              </li>
              <li>
                The work is a sound recording that was first fixed in a treaty
                party; or
              </li>
              <li>
                The work is a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that is
                incorporated in a building or other structure, or an
                architectural work that is embodied in a building and the
                building or structure is located in the Unites States or a
                treaty party; or
              </li>
              <li>
                The work is first published by the United Nations or any of its
                specialized agencies, or by the Organization of American States;
                or
              </li>
              <li>
                The work is a foreign work that was in the public domain in the
                United States prior to 1996 and its copyright was restored under
                that Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA). See Circular 38B,
                Highlights of Copyright Amendments Contained in the Uruguay
                Round Agreements Act (URAA-GATT) for further information
              </li>
              <li>
                the work comes within the scope of a presidential proclamation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />A treaty party is a country or intergovernmental organization
            other than the United States that is a party to an international
            agreement.
          </p>
          <h3>What Works Are Protected?</h3>
          <p>
            Copyright protects “original works of authorship” that are fixed in
            a tangible form of expresion. The fixation need not be directly
            perceptible so long as it may be communicated with the aid of a
            machine or device. Copyrightable works include the following
            categories:
            <ul>
              <li>Literary works</li>
              <li>Mustical works, including any accompanying words</li>
              <li>Dramatic works, including any accompanying music</li>
              <li>Pantomimes and choreographic works</li>
              <li>Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works</li>
              <li>Motion pictures and other audiovisual works</li>
              <li>Sound recordings</li>
              <li>Architectural works</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            The categories should be viewed bradly. For example, computer
            programs and most “compilations” may be registered as “literary
            works”; maps and architectural plans may be registered as
            “pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.”
          </p>
          <h3>What is Not Protected by Copyright?</h3>
          <p>
            Several categories of material are generally not eligible for
            federal copyright protection. These include among others:
            <ul>
              <li>
                works that have not been fixed in a tangible for mof xpression
                (for example, choreographic works that have not been notated or
                recorded, or improvisational speeches or performances that have
                not been written or recorded)
              </li>
              <li>
                titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or
                designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation,
                lettering, or coloring; mere listings of ingredients or contents
                - ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts,
                principles, discoveries, or devices, as distinguished from a
                description, explanation, or illustration
              </li>
              <li>
                works consisting entirely of information that is common property
                and containing no original authorship (for example: standard
                calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers,
                and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common
                sources)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>How to Secure a Copyright</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Copyright Secured Automatically upon Creation</strong>
            The way in which copyright protection is secured is frequently
            misunderstood. No publication or registration or other action in the
            Copyright Office is required to secure copyright. See the following
            note. There are, however, certain definite advantages to
            registration. See Copyright Registration on page 7. Copyright is
            secured automatically when the work is created, and a work is
            “created” when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first
            time. “Copies” are material objects from which a work can be read or
            visually perceived either directly or with the aid of a machine or
            device, such as books, manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or
            microfilm
            <br />
            “Phonorecords” are material objects embodying fixations of sounds
            (excluding, by statutory definition, motion picture soundtracks),
            such as cassette tapes, CDs, or vinyl disks. Thus, for example, a
            song (the “work”) can be fixed in sheet music (“copies”) or in
            phonograph disks (“phonorecords”), or both. If a work is prepared
            over a period of time, the part of the work that is fixed on a
            particular date constitutes the created work as of that date.
          </p>
          <h3>Publication</h3>
          <p>
            Publication is no longer the key to obtaining federal copyright as
            it was under the Copyright Act of 1909. However, publication remains
            important to copyright owners.
            <small>
              *Publication* is the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a
              work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by
              rental, lease, or lending. The offering to distribute copies or
              phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further
              distribution constitutes publication. A public performance or
              display of a work does not of itself constitute publication.
            </small>
            <br />
            Note: Before 1978, federal copyright was generally secured by the
            act of publication with notice of copyright, assuming compliance
            with all other relevant statutory conditions. U.S. works in the
            public domain on January 1, 19978, (for example, works published
            without satisfying all conditions for securing the federal copyright
            under the Copyright Act of 1909) remain in the public domain under
            the 1976 Copyright Act.
            <br />
            Certain foreign works originally published without notice had their
            copyrights restored under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA).
            See circular 38B and see Notice of Copyright section on page 4 for
            further information.
            <br />
            Federal copyright could also be secured before 1978 by the act of
            registration in the case of certain unpublished works and works
            eligible for ad interim copyright. The 1976 Copyright Act
            automatically extended copyright protection to full term for all
            works that, as of January 1, 1978, were subject to statutory
            protection.
            <br />A further discussion of the definition of “publication” can be
            found in the legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Act. The
            legislative reports define “to the public” or implicit restrictions
            with respect to disclosure of the contents. The reports state that
            the definition makes it clear that the sale of phonorecords
            constitutes publication of the underlying work, for example, the
            musical, dramatic, or literary work embodied in a phonorecord. The
            reports also state that it is clear that any form of dissemination
            in which the material object does not change hands, for example,
            performances or displays on television, is not a publication no
            matter how many people are exposed to the work. However, when copies
            or phono-records are offered for sale or lease to a group of
            wholesalers, broadcasters, or motion picture theaters, publication
            does take place if the purpose is further distribution, public
            performance, or public display.
            <br />
            Publication is an important concept in the copyright law for several
            reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Works that are published in the United States are subject to
                mandatory deposit with the Library of Congress. See discussion
                on “Mandatory Deposit for Works Published in the United Sates”
                on page 10
              </li>
              <li>
                Publication of a work can affect the limitations on the
                exclusive rights of the copyright owner that are set forth in
                sections 107 through 122 of the law
              </li>
              <li>
                The year of publication may determine the duration of copyright
                protection for anonymous and pseudonymous works (when the
                author’s identity is not revealed in the records of the
                Copyright Office) and for works made for hire
              </li>
              <li>
                Deposit requirements for registration of published works differ
                from those for registration of unpublished works. See discussion
                on “Registration Procedures” on page 7.
              </li>
              <li>
                When a work is published, it may bear a notice of copyright to
                identify the year of publication and the name of the copyright
                owner and to inform the public that the work is protected by
                copyright. Copies of works published before Match 1989 must bear
                the notice or risk loss of copyright protection. See discussion
                on “Notice of Copyright” below.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Notice of Copyright</h3>
          <p>
            The use of a copyright notice is no longer required under U. S. law,
            although it is often beneficial. Because prior law did contain such
            a requirement, however, the use of notice is still relevant to the
            copyright status of older works. Notice was required under the 1976
            Copyright Act. This requirement was eliminated when the United
            States adhered to the Berne Convention, effective March 1, 1989.
            Although works published without notice before that date could have{" "}
            <br />
            entered the public domain in the United States, the Uruguay Round
            Agreements Act (URAA) restores copyright in certain foreign works
            originally published without notice. For fur- ther information about
            copyright amendments in the URAA, see Circular 38b.
            <br />
            The Copyright Office does not take a position on whether copies of
            works first published with notice before March 1, 1989, which are
            distributed on or after March 1, 1989, must bear the copyright
            notice.
            <br />
            Use of the notice may be important because it informs the public
            that the work is protected by copyright, identifies the copyright
            owner, and shows the year of first publication. Furthermore, in the
            event that a work is infringed, if a proper notice of copyright
            appears on the published copy or copies to which a defendant in a
            copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be
            given to such a defendant’s interposition of a defense based on
            innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages,
            except as provided in section 504(c)(2) of the copyright law.
            Innocent infringement occurs when the infringer did not realize that
            the work was protected. The use of the copyright notice is the
            responsibility of the copyright owner and does not require advance
            permission from, or registration with, the Copyright Office
            <small>Form of Notice for Visually Perceptible Copies</small>
            The notice for visually perceptible copies should contain all the
            following three elements:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The symbol © (the letter C in a circle), or the word,
                “Copyright,” or the abbreviation “Copr.”; and
              </li>
              <li>
                . The year of first publication of the work. In the case of
                compilations or derivative works incorporating previously
                published material, the year date of first publication of the
                compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year date may
                be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with
                accompanying textual matter, if any, is reproduced in or on
                greeting cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or
                any useful article; and
              </li>
              <li>
                The name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an
                abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally
                known alternative designation of the owner
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            The "C in a circle" notice is used only on "visually perceptible
            copies." Certain kinds of works-for example, musical, dramatic, and
            literary works-may be fixed not in "copies" but by means of sound in
            an audio recording. Since audio recordings such as audio tapes and
            phonograph disks are "phonorecords" and not "copies," the "C in a
            circle" notice is not used to indicate protection of the underlying
            musical, dramatic, or literary work that is recorded.
            <small>Form of Notice for Phonorecords of Sound Recordings</small>
            The notice for phonorecords embodying a sound recording should
            contain all the following three elements:
            <ul>
              <li>The symbol p (the letter P in a circle); and</li>
              <li>The year of first publication of the sound recording; and</li>
              <li>
                . The name of te owner of copyright in the sound recording, or
                an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or an
                abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or generally
                known alternative designation of the owner. If the producer of
                the sound recording is named on the phonorecord label or
                container and if no other name appears in conjunction with the
                notice, the producer’s name shall be considered a part of the
                notice.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Example: p 2011 A.B.C. Records Inc
            <br />
            <small>
              Note: Since questions may arise from the use of variant forms of
              the notice, you may wish to seek legal advice before using any
              form of the notice other than those given here.
            </small>
            <small>Position of Notice</small>
            The copyright notice should be affixed to copies or phonorecords in
            such a way as to “give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright.”
            The three elements of the notice should ordinarily appear together
            on the copies or phonorecords or on the phonorecord label or
            container. The Copyright Office has issued regulations concerning
            the form and position of the copyright notice in the Code of Federal
            Regulations (37 CFR 201.20). For more information, see Circular 3,
            Copyright Notice.
            <small>Publications Incorporating U.S. Government Works</small>
            Works by the U. S. government are not eligible for U. S. copyright
            protection. For works published on and after March 1, 1989, the
            previous notice requirement for works consisting primarily of one or
            more U. S. government works has been eliminated. However, use of a
            notice on such a work will defeat a claim of innocent infringement
            as previously described provided the notice also includes a
            statement that identifies either those portions of the work in which
            copyright is claimed or those portions that constitute U. S.
            government material.
            <br />
            Example: © 2011 Jane Brown Copyright claimed in chapters 7–10,
            exclusive of U. S. government maps. Copies of works published before
            March 1, 1989, that consist primarily of one or more works of the U.
            S. government should have a notice and the identifying statement.
            <small>Unpublished Works</small>
            The author or copyright owner may wish to place a copyright notice
            on any unpublished copies or phonorecords that leave his or her
            control.
            <br />
            Example: Unpublished work C 2011 Jane Doe
            <small>Omission of Notice and Errors in Notice</small>
            <br />
            The 1976 Copyright Act attempted to ameliorate the strict
            consequences of failure to include notice under prior law. It
            contained provisions that set out specific corrective steps to cure
            omissions or certain errors in notice. Under these provisions, an
            applicant had five years after publication to cure omission of
            notice or certain errors. Although these provisions are technically
            still in the law, their impact has been limited by the amendment
            making notice optional for all works published on and after March 1,
            1989. For further information, see Circular 3.
          </p>
          <h3>Duration of Copyright Protection</h3>
          <p>
            <small>Works Originally Created on or after January 1, 1978</small>
            <br />A work that was created (fixed in tangible form for the first
            time) on or after January 1, 1978, is automatically protected from
            the moment of its creation and is ordinarily given a term enduring
            for the author’s life plus an additional 70 years after the author’s
            death. In the case of “a joint work prepared by two or more authors
            who did not work for hire,” the term lasts for 70 years after the
            last surviving author’s death. For works made for hire, and for
            anonymous and pseudonymous works (unless the author’s identity is
            revealed in Copyright Office records), the duration of copyright
            will be 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation,
            whichever is shorter.
            <br />
            <small>
              Works Originally Created Before January 1, 1978, But Not Published
              or Registered by That Date
            </small>
            <br />
            These works have been automatically brought under the statute and
            are now given federal copyright protection. The duration of
            copyright in these works is generally computed in the same way as
            for works created on or after January 1, 1978: the life-plus-70 or
            95/120-year terms apply to them as well. The law provides that in no
            case would the term of copy right for works in this category expire
            before December 31, 2002, and for works published on or before
            December 31, 2002, the term of copyright will not expire before
            December 31, 2047.
            <br />
            <small>
              Works Originally Created and Published or Registered before
              January 1, 1978
            </small>
            <br />
            Under the law in effect before 1978, copyright was secured either on
            the date a work was published with a copyright notice or on the date
            of registration if the work was registered in unpublished form. In
            either case, the copyright endured for a first term of 28 years from
            the date it was secured. During the last (28th) year of the first
            term, the copyright was eligible for renewal. The Copyright Act of
            1976 extended the renewal term from 28 to 47 years for copyrights
            that were subsisting on January 1, 1978, or for pre-1978 copyrights
            restored under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), making these
            works eligible for a total term of protection of 75 years. Public
            Law 105-298, enacted on October 27, 1998, further extended the
            renewal term of copyrights still subsisting on that date by an
            additional 20 years, providing for a renewal term of 67 years and a
            total term of protection of 95 years. Public Law 102-307, enacted on
            June 26, 1992, amended the 1976 Copyright Act to provide for
            automatic renewal of the term of copyrights secured between January
            1, 1964, and December 31, 1977. Although the renewal term is
            automatically provided, the Copyright Office does not issue a
            renewal certificate for these works unless a renewal application and
            fee are received and registered in the Copyright Office. Public Law
            102-307 makes renewal registration optional. Thus, filing for
            renewal registration is no longer required to extend the original
            28-year copyright term to the full 95 years. However, some benefits
            accrue to renewal registrations that were made during the 28th year.
            For more detailed information on renewal of copyright and the
            copyright term, see Circular 15, Renewal of Copyright; Circular 15a,
            Duration of Copyright; and Circular 15t, Extension of Copyright
            Terms
          </p>
          <h3>Transfer of Copyright </h3>
          <p>
            Any or all of the copyright owner’s exclusive rights or any
            subdivision of those rights may be transferred, but the transfer of
            exclusive rights is not valid unless that transfer is in writing and
            signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner’s duly
            authorized agent. Transfer of a right on a nonexclusive basis does
            not require a written agreement. A copyright may also be conveyed by
            operation of law and may be bequeathed by will or pass as personal
            property by the applicable laws of intestate succession. Copyright
            is a personal property right, and it is subject to the various state
            laws and regulations that govern the ownership, inheritance, or
            transfer of personal property as well as terms of contracts or
            conduct of business. For information about relevant state laws,
            consult an attorney. Transfers of copyright are normally made by
            contract. The Copyright Office does not have any forms for such
            transfers. The law does provide for the recordation in the Copyright
            Office of transfers of copyright ownership. Although recordation is
            not required to make a valid transfer between the parties, it does
            provide certain legal advantages and may be required to validate the
            transfer as against third parties. For information on recordation of
            transfers and other documents related to copyright, see Circular 12,
            Recordation of Transfers and Other Documents.
            <br />
            <small>Termination of Transfers</small>
            <br />
            Under the previous law, the copyright in a work reverted to the
            author, if living, or if the author was not living, to other
            specified beneficiaries, provided a renewal claim was registered in
            the 28th year of the original term.* The present law drops the
            renewal feature except for works already in the first term of
            statutory protection when the present law took effect. Instead, the
            present law permits termination of a grant of rights after 35 years
            under certain conditions by serving written notice on the transferee
            within specified time limits. For works already under statutory
            copyright protection before 1978, the present law provides a similar
            right of termination covering the newly added years that extended
            the former maximum term of the copyright from 56 to 95 years. For
            further information, see circulars 15a and 15t.
            <br />
            note: The copyright in works eligible for renewal on or after June
            26, 1992, will vest in the name of the renewal claimant on the
            effective date of any renewal registration made during the 28th year
            of the original term. Otherwise, the renewal copyright will vest in
            the party entitled to claim renewal as of December 31st of the 28th
            year.
          </p>
          <h3>International Copyright Protection</h3>
          <p>
            There is no such thing as an “international copyright” that will
            automatically protect an author’s writings throughout the entire
            world. Protection against unauthorized use in a particular country
            depends, basically, on the national laws of that country. However,
            most countries do offer protection to foreign works under certain
            conditions, and these conditions have been greatly simplified by
            international copyright treaties and conventions. For further
            information and a list of countries that maintain copyright
            relations with the United States, see Circular 38a, International
            Copyright Relations of the United States
          </p>
          <h3>Copyright Registration</h3>
          <p>
            In general, copyright registration is a legal formality intended to
            make a public record of the basic facts of a particular copyright.
            However, registration is not a condition of copyright protection.
            Even though registration is not a requirement for protection, the
            copyright law provides several inducements or advantages to
            encourage copyright owners to make registration. Among these
            advantages are the following
            <ul>
              <li>
                Registration establishes a public record of the copyright claim
              </li>
              <li>
                Before an infringement suit may be filed in court, registration
                is necessary for works of U. S. origin.
              </li>
              <li>
                If made before or within five years of publication, registration
                will establish prima facie evidence in court of the validity of
                the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.
              </li>
              <li>
                If registration is made within three months after publication of
                the work or prior to an infringement of the work, statutory
                damages and attorney’s fees will be available to the copyright
                owner in court actions. Otherwise, only an award of actual
                damages and profits is available to the copyright owner
              </li>
              <li>
                Registration allows the owner of the copyright to record the
                registration with the U. S. Customs Service for protection
                against the importation of infringing copies. For additional
                nformation, go to the U. S. Customs and Border Protection
                website at
                <Link to="/">www.cbp.gov/</Link>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Registration may be made at any time within the life of the
            copyright. Unlike the law before 1978, when a work has been
            registered in unpublished form, it is not necessary to make another
            registration when the work becomes published, although the copyright
            owner may register the published edition, if desired.
          </p>
          <h3>Registration Procedures</h3>
          <p>
            <small>
              Filing an Original Claim to Copyright with the U.S. Copyright
              Office
            </small>
            <br />
            An application for copyright registration contains three essential
            elements: a completed application form, a nonrefundable filing fee,
            and a nonreturnable deposit—that is, a copy or copies of the work
            being registered and “deposited” with the Copyright Office. If you
            apply online for copyright registration, you will receive an email
            saying that your application was received
            <br />
            If you apply for copyright registration using a paper application,
            you will not receive an acknowledgment that your application has
            been received (the Office receives more than 600,000 applications
            annually). With either online or paper applications, you can expect:
            <ul>
              <li>
                a letter, telephone call or email from a Copyright Office staff
                member if further information is needed or
              </li>
              <li>
                a certificate of registration indicating that the work has been
                registered, or if the application cannot be accepted, a letter
                explaining why it has been rejected
              </li>
            </ul>
            Requests to have certificates available for pickup in the Public
            Information Office or to have certificates sent by Federal Express
            or another mail service cannot be honored. If you apply using a
            paper application and you want to know the date that the Copyright
            Office receives your material, send it by registered or certified
            mail and request a return receipt. You can apply to register your
            copyright in one of two ways.
          </p>
          <h3>Online Application</h3>
          <p>
            Online registration through the electronic Copyright Office (eCO) is
            the preferred way to register basic claims for literary works;
            visual arts works; performing arts works, including motion pictures;
            sound recordings; and single serials. Advantages of online filing
            include:
            <ul>
              <li>a lower filing fee</li>
              <li>the fastest processing time</li>
              <li>online status tracking</li>
              <li>
                secure payment by credit or debit card, electronic check, or
                Copyright Office deposit account
              </li>
              <li>
                the ability to upload certain categories of deposits directly
                into eCO as electronic files
              </li>
            </ul>
            *Note: You can still register using eCO and save money even if you
            will submit a hard-copy deposit, which is required under the
            mandatory deposit requirements for certain published works. The
            system will prompt you to specify whether you intend to submit an
            electronic or a hard-copy deposit, and it will provide instructions
            accordingly.
            <br />
            Basic claims include (1) a single work; (2) multiple unpublished
            works if the elements are assembled in an orderly form; the combined
            elements bear a single title identifying the collection as a whole;
            the copyright claimant in all the elements and in the collection as
            a whole is the same; and all the elements are by the same author or,
            if they are by different authors, at least one of the authors has
            contributed copyrightable authorship to each element; and (3)
            multiple published works if they are all first published together in
            the same publication on the same date and owned by the same
            claimant. <br />
            Online submissions of groups of published photographs and automated
            databases consisting predominantly of photographs may be permitted
            if the applicant first calls the Visual Arts Division (202)
            707-8202) for approval and special instructions. See the Copyright
            Office website at<Link to="">www.copyright.gov</Link> for further
            information. To access eCO, go to the Copyright Office website and
            click on electronic Copyright Office.
          </p>
          <h3>Paper Application</h3>
          <p>
            You can also register your copyright using forms TX (literary
            works); VA (visual arts works); PA (performing arts works, including
            motion pictures); SR (sound recordings); and SE (single serials). To
            access all forms, go to the Copyright Office website and click on
            Forms. On your personal computer, complete the form for the type of
            work you are registering, print it out, and mail it with a check or
            money order and your deposit. Blank forms can also be printed out
            and completed by hand, or they may be requested by postal mail or by
            calling the Forms and Publications Hotline at (202) 707-9100 (limit
            of two copies of each form by mail). Informational circulars about
            the types of applications and current registration fees are
            available on the Copyright Office website at{" "}
            <Link to="/"> www.copyright.gov </Link>or by phone.
          </p>
          <h3>Applications That Must Be Completed on Paper</h3>
          <p>
            Certain applications must be completed on paper and mailed to the
            Copyright Office with the appropriate fee and deposit. Forms for
            these applications include the following:

            Deposit Requirements
            <br />
            If you file an application for copyright registration online using
            eCO, you may in some cases attach an electronic copy of your
            deposit. If you do not have an electronic copy or if you must send a
            hard copy or copies of your deposit to comply with the “best
            edition” requirements for published works, you must print out a
            shipping slip, attach it to your deposit, and mail the deposit to
            the Copyright Office. Send the deposit, fee, and paper registration
            form packaged together to:
            <ul>
              <li>Library of Congress </li>
              <li>U.S. Copyright Office </li>
              <li>101 Independence Avenue SE </li>
              <li>Washington, DC 20559</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            The hard-copy deposit of the work being registered will not be
            returned to you. The deposit requirements vary in particular
            situations. The general requirements follow.
            <br />
            Also note the information under “Special Deposit Requirements” in
            the next column
            <ul>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                if the work was first published in the United States on or after
                January 1, 1978, two complete copies or phonorecords of the best
                edition{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                if the work was first published in the United States before
                January 1, 1978, two complete copies or phonorecords of the work
                as first published
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                if the work was first published outside the United States,one
                complete copy or phonorecord of the work as first published
              </li>
            </ul>
            When registering with eCO, you will receive via your printer a
            shipping slip that you must include with your deposit that you send
            to the Copyright Office. This shipping slip is unique to your claim
            to copyright and will link your deposit to your application. Do not
            reuse the shipping slip.
            <br />
            note: It is imperative when sending multiple works that you place
            all applications, deposits, and fees in the same package. If it is
            not possible to fit everything in one package, number each package
            (e.g., 1 of 3; 2 of 4) to facilitate processing and, where possible,
            attach applications to the appropriate deposits.
          </p>
          <h3>Special Deposit Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Special deposit requirements exist for many types of works. The
            following are prominent examples of exceptions to the general
            deposit requirements:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the work is a motion picture, the deposit requirement is one
                complete copy of the unpublished or published motion picture and
                a separate written description of its contents, such as a
                continuity, press book, or synopsis of your deposit.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the work is a literary, dramatic, or musical work published
                only in a phonorecord, the deposit requirement is one complete
                phonorecord
              </li>
              <li>
                If the work is an unpublished or published computer program, the
                deposit requirement is one visually perceptible copy in source
                code of the first 25 and last 25 pages of the program. For a
                program of fewer than 50 pages, the deposit is a copy of the
                entire program. For more information on computer programs
                registration, including deposits for revised programs and
                provisions for trade secrets, see Circular 61, Copyright
                Registration for Computer Programs.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the work is in a CD-ROM format, the deposit requirement is
                one complete copy of the material, that is, the CD-ROM, the
                operating software, and any manual(s) accompanying it. If
                registration is sought for the computer program on the CD-ROM,
                the deposit should also include a printout of the first 25 and
                last 25 pages of source code for the program.
              </li>
            </ul>
            In the case of works reproduced in three-dimensional copies,
            identifying material such as photographs or drawings is ordinarily
            required. Other examples of special deposit requirements (but by no
            means an exhaustive list) include many works of the visual arts such
            as greeting cards, toys, fabrics, and oversized materials (see
            Circular 40a, Deposit Requirements for Registration of Claims to
            Copyright in Visual Arts Material); computer programs, video games,
            and other machine-readable audiovisual works (see Circular 61);
            automated databases (see Circular 65, Copyright Registration for
            Automated Databases); and contributions to collective works. For
            information about deposit requirements for group registration of
            serials, see Circular 62, Copyright Registration for Serials.
            <br />
            If you are unsure of the deposit requirement for your work, write or
            call the Copyright Office and describe the work you wish to
            register.
            <br />
            <small>Unpublished Collections</small>
            <br />
            Under the following conditions, a work may be registered in
            unpublished form as a “collection,” with one application form and
            one fee:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The elements of the collection are assembled in an orderly form
              </li>
              <li>
                The combined elements bear a single title identifying the
                collection as a whole;
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                The copyright claimant in all the elements and in the collection
                as a whole is the same; and
              </li>
              <li>
                All the elements are by the same author, or, if they are by
                different authors, at least one of the authors has contributed
                copyrightable authorship to each element.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Note: A Library of Congress Control Number is different from a
            copyright registration number. The Cataloging in Publication (CIP)
            Division of the Library of Congress is responsible for assigning LC
            Control Numbers and is operationally separate from the Copyright
            Office. A book may be registered in or deposited with the Copyright
            Office nut not necessarily cataloged and added to the Library’s
            collections. For information about obtaining an LC Control number,

            <small>Filing a Preregistration</small>
            <br />
            Preregistration is a service intended for works that have had a
            history of prerelease infringement. To be eligible for
            preregistration, a work must be unpublished and must be in the
            process of being prepared for commercial distribution. It must also
            fall within a class of works determined by the Register of
            Copyrights to have had a history of infringement prior to authorized
            commercial distribution. Preregistration is not a substitute for
            registration. The preregistration application Form PRE is only
            available online. For further information, go to the Copyright
            Office website at
            <Link to="/">www.copyright.gov.</Link>
          </p>
          <h3>Effective Date of Registration</h3>
          <p>
            When the Copyright Office issues a registration certificate, it
            assigns as the effective date of registration the date it received
            all required elements—an application, a non-refundable filing fee,
            and a nonreturnable deposit—in acceptable form, regardless of how
            long it took to process the application and mail the certificate.
            You do not have to receive your certificate before you publish or
            produce your work, nor do you need permission from the Copyright
            Office to place a copyright notice on your work. However, the
            Copyright Office must have acted on your application before you can
            file a suit for copyright infringement, and certain remedies, such
            as statutory damages and attorney’s fees, are available only for
            acts of infringement that occurred after the effective date of
            registration. If a published work was infringed before the effective
            date of registration, those remedies may also be available if the
            effective date of registration is no later than three months after
            the first publication of the work.{" "}
          </p>
          <h3>Corrections and Amplifications of Existing Registrations</h3>
          <p>
            To correct an error in a copyright registration or to amplify the
            information given in a registration, file with the Copyright Office
            a supplementary registration Form CA. File Form CA in the same
            manner as described above under Registration Procedures. The
            information in a supplementary registration augments but does not
            supersede that contained in the earlier registration. Note also that
            a supplementary registration is not a substitute for original
            registration, for renewal registration, or for recordation of a
            transfer of ownership. For further information about supplementary
            registration, see Circular 8, Supplementary Copyright Registration.
          </p>
          <h3>Mandatory Deposit for Works Published in the United States</h3>
          <p>
            Although a copyright registration is not required, the Copyright Act
            establishes a mandatory deposit requirement for works published in
            the United States. See the definition of “publication” on page 3. In
            general, the owner of copyright or the owner of the exclusive right
            of publication in the work has a legal obligation to deposit in the
            Copyright Office, within three months of publication in the United
            States, two copies (or in the case of sound recordings, two
            phonorecords) for the use of the Library of Congress. Failure to
            make the deposit can result in fines and other penalties but does
            not affect copyright protection. If a registration for a claim to
            copyright in a published work is filed online and the deposit is
            submitted online, the actual physical deposit must still be
            submitted to satisfy mandatory deposit requirements. Certain
            categories of works are exempt entirely from the mandatory deposit
            requirements, and the obligation is reduced for certain other
            categories. For further information about mandatory deposit, see
            Circular 7d, Mandatory Deposit of Copies or Phonorecords for the
            Library of Congress.
          </p>
          <h3>Use of Mandatory Deposit to Satisfy Registration Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            For works published in the United States, the copyright law contains
            a provision under which a single deposit can be made to satisfy both
            the deposit requirements for the Library and the registration
            requirements. To have this dual effect, the copies or phonorecords
            must be accompanied by the prescribed application form and filing
            fee. If applicable, a copy of the mandatory deposit notice must also
            be included with the submission.
          </p>
          <h3>Who May File an Application Form?</h3>
          <p>
            The following persons are legally entitled to submit an application
            form:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The author. This is either the person who actually created the
                work or, if the work was made for hire, the employer or other
                person for whom the work was prepared.
              </li>
              <li>
                The copyright claimant. The copyright claimant is defined in
                Copyright Office regulations as either the author of the work or
                a person or organization that has obtained ownership of all the
                rights under the copyright initially belonging to the author.
                This category includes a person or organization who has obtained
                by contract the right to claim legal title to the copyright in
                an application for copyright registration.
              </li>
              <li>
                The owner of exclusive right(s). Under the law, any of the
                exclusive rights that make up a copyright and any subdivision of
                them can be transferred and owned separately, even though the
                transfer may be limited in time or place of effect. The term
                “copyright owner” with respect to any one of the exclusive
                rights contained in a copyright refers to the owner of that
                particular right. Any owner of an exclusive right may apply for
                registration of a claim in the work.
              </li>
              <li>
                The duly authorized agent of such author, other copy right
                claimant, or owner of exclusive right(s). Any person authorized
                to act on behalf of the author, other copyright claimant, or
                owner of exclusive rights may apply for registration.
              </li>
            </ul>
            There is no requirement that applications be prepared or filed by an
            attorney
          </p>
          <h3>Fees*</h3>
          <p>
            All remittances that are not made online or by deposit account
            should be in the form of drafts, that is, checks, money orders, or
            bank drafts, payable to Register of Copyrights. Do not send cash.
            Drafts must be redeemable without service or exchange fee through a
            U. S. institution, must be payable in U. S. dollars, and must be
            imprinted with American Banking Association routing numbers.
            International Money Orders and Postal Money Orders that are
            negotiable only at a post office are not acceptable. If a check
            received in payment of the filing fee is returned to the Copyright
            Office as uncollectible, the Copyright Office will cancel the
            registration and will notify the remitter. The filing fee for
            processing an original, supplementary, or renewal claim is
            nonrefundable, whether or not copyright registration is ultimately
            made. Do not send cash. The Copyright Office cannot assume any

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <h3>Copyright in General</h3>
          <p>
            <small>What is Copyright?</small>
            <br />
            Copyright is a form of protection grounded in the U.S. Constitution
            and granted by law for original works of authorship fixed in a
            tangible medium of expression. Copyright covers both published and
            unpublished works.
            <br />
            <small>What does copyright protect?</small>
            <br />
            Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original
            works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and
            artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer
            software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas,
            systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way
            these things are expressed. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics,
            section "What Works Are Protected."
            <br />
            <small>
              How is a copyright different from a patent or a trademark?
            </small>
            <br />
            Copyright protects original works of authorship, while a patent
            protects inventions or discoveries. Ideas and discoveries are not
            protected by the copyright law, although the way in which they are
            expressed may be. A trademark protects words, phrases, symbols, or
            designs identifying the source of the goods or services of one party
            and distinguishing them from those of others.
            <br />
            <small>When is my work protected?</small>
            <br />
            Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and
            fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or
            with the aid of a machine or device.
            <br />
            <small>
              Do I have to register with your office to be protected?
            </small>
            <br />
            No. In general, registration is voluntary. Copyright exists from the
            moment the work is created. You will have to register, however, if
            you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work. See
            Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section “Copyright Registration.”
            <br />
            <small>
              Why should I register my work if copyright protection is
              automatic?
            </small>
            <br />
            Registration is recommended for a number of reasons. Many choose to
            register their works because they wish to have the facts of their
            copyright on the public record and have a certificate of
            registration. Registered works may be eligible for statutory damages
            and attorney's fees in successful litigation. Finally, if
            registration occurs within 5 years of publication, it is considered
            prima facie evidence in a court of law. See Circular 1, Copyright
            Basics, section “Copyright Registration” and Circular 38b,
            Highlights of Copyright Amendments Contained in the Uruguay Round
            Agreements Act (URAA), on non-U.S. works.
            <br />
            <small>
              I’ve heard about a “poor man’s copyright.” What is it?
            </small>
            <br />
            The practice of sending a copy of your own work to yourself is
            sometimes called a “poor man’s copyright.” There is no provision in
            the copyright law regarding any such type of protection, and it is
            not a substitute for registration.
            <br />
            <small>Is my copyright good in other countries?</small>
            <br />
            The United States has copyright relations with most countries
            throughout the world, and as a result of these agreements, we honor
            each other's citizens' copyrights. However, the United States does
            not have such copyright relationships with every country. For a
            listing of countries and the nature of their copyright relations
            with the United States, see Circular 38a, International Copyright
            Relations of the United States.

          <h3>What Does Copyright Protect?</h3>
          <p>
            <small>What does copyright protect?</small>
            <br />
            Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original
            works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and
            artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer
            software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas,
            systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way
            these things are expressed. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics,
            section "What Works Are Protected."
            <br />
            <small>Can I copyright my website?</small>
            <br />
            The original authorship appearing on a website may be protected by
            copyright. This includes writings, artwork, photographs, and other
            forms of authorship protected by copyright. Procedures for
            registering the contents of a website may be found in Circular 66,
            Copyright Registration for Online Works
            <br />
            <small>Can I copyright my domain name?</small>
            <br />
            Copyright law does not protect domain names. The Internet
            Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a nonprofit
            organization that has assumed the responsibility for domain name
            system management, administers the assignation of domain names
            through accredited registers.
            <br />
            <small>How do I protect my recipe?</small>
            <br />A mere listing of ingredients is not protected under copyright
            law. However, where a recipe or formula is accompanied by
            substantial literary expression in the form of an explanation or
            directions, or when there is a collection of recipes as in a
            cookbook, there may be a basis for copyright protection. Note that
            if you have secret ingredients to a recipe that you do not wish to
            be revealed, you should not submit your recipe for registration,
            because applications and deposit copies are public records. See FL
            122, Recipes.
            <br />
            <small>Can I copyright the name of my band?</small>
            <br />
            No. Names are not protected by copyright law. Some names may be
            protected under trademark law. Contact the U.S. Patent & Trademark
            Office, 800-786-9199, for further information.
            <br />
            <small>How do I copyright a name, title, slogan, or logo?</small>
            <br />
            Copyright does not protect names, titles, slogans, or short phrases.
            In some cases, these things may be protected as trademarks. Contact
            the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, 800-786-9199, for further
            information. However, copyright protection may be available for logo
            artwork that contains sufficient authorship. In some circumstances,
            an artistic logo may also be protected as a trademark.
            <br />
            <small>How do I protect my idea?</small>
            <br />
            Copyright does not protect ideas, concepts, systems, or methods of
            doing something. You may express your ideas in writing or drawings
            and claim copyright in your description, but be aware that copyright
            will not protect the idea itself as revealed in your written or
            artistic work.
            <br />
            <small>Does my work have to be published to be protected?</small>
            <br />
            Publication is not necessary for copyright protection.
            <br />
            <small>
              Can I register a diary I found in my grandmother's attic?
            </small>
            <br />
            You can register copyright in the diary only if you own the rights
            to the work, for example, by will or by inheritance. Copyright is
            the right of the author of the work or the author's heirs or
            assignees, not of the one who only owns or possesses the physical
            work itself. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section “Who Can
            Claim Copyright.”
            <br />
            <small>How do I protect my sighting of Elvis?</small>
            <br />
            Copyright law does not protect sightings. However, copyright law
            will protect your photo (or other depiction) of your sighting of
            Elvis. File your claim to copyright online by means of the
            electronic Copyright Office (eCO). Pay the fee online and attach a
            copy of your photo. For more information on registering a copyright,
            see SL-35. No one can lawfully use your photo of your sighting,
            although someone else may file his own photo of his sighting.
            Copyright law protects the original photograph, not the subject of
            the photograph.
            <br />
            <small>Does copyright protect architecture?</small>
            <br />
            Yes. Architectural works became subject to copyright protection on
            December 1, 1990. The copyright law defines “architectural work” as
            “the design of a building embodied in any tangible medium of
            expression, including a building, architectural plans, or drawings.”
            Copyright protection extends to any architectural work created on or
            after December 1, 1990. Also, any architectural works that were
            unconstructed and embodied in unpublished plans or drawings on that
            date and were constructed by December 31, 2002, are eligible for
            protection. Architectural designs embodied in buildings constructed
            prior to December 1, 1990, are not eligible for copyright
            protection. See Circ ular 41, Copyright Claims in Architectural
            Works

            <small>
              Can I get a star named after me and claim copyright to it?
            </small>
            <br />
            No. There is a lot of misunderstanding about this. Names are not
            protected by copyright. Publishers of works such as a star registry
            may register a claim to copyright in the text of the volume [or
            book] containing the names the registry has assigned to stars, and
            perhaps the compilation of data; but such a registration would not
            extend protection to any of the individual star names appearing
            therein. Copyright registration of such a volume of star names does
            not confer any official or governmental status on any of the star
            names included in the volume. For further information on copyright
            protection and names, see Circular 34, Copyright Protection Not
            Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases

              Can foreigners register their works in the United States?
            </small>
            <br />
            Any work that is protected by U.S. copyright law can be registered.
            This includes many works of foreign origin. All works that are
            unpublished, regardless of the nationality of the author, are
            protected in the United States. Works that are first published in
            the United States or in a country with which we have a copyright
            treaty or that are created by a citizen or domiciliary of a country
            with which we have a copyright treaty are also protected and may
            therefore be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. See Circular
            38a, International Copyright Relations of the United States, for the
            status of specific countries.
            <br />
            <small>Can a minor claim copyright?</small>
            <br />
            Minors may claim copyright, and the Copyright Office issues
            registrations to minors, but state laws may regulate the business
            dealings involving copyrights owned by minors. For information on
            relevant state laws, consult an attorney.
            <br />
            <small>
              Can I register a diary I found in my grandmother's attic?
            </small>
            <br />
            You can register copyright in the diary only if you own the rights
            to the work, for example, by will or by inheritance. Copyright is
            the right of the author of the work or the author's heirs or
            assignees, not of the one who only owns or possesses the physical
            work itself. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section “Who Can
            Claim Copyright.”

          <h3>Registering a Work</h3>
          <p>
            <small>How do I register my copyright?</small>
            <br />
            To register a work, submit a completed application form, a
            nonrefundable filing fee, which is $35 if you register online; and a
            nonreturnable copy or copies of the work to be registered. See
            Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section “Registration Procedures.”
            <br />
            <small>Where can I get application forms?</small>
            <br />
            See SL-35.
            <br />
            <small>Can I file online?</small>
            <br />
            Yes. We offer online registration through our electronic Copyright
            Office (eCO) at a reduced fee of $35. See SL-35.
            <br />
            <small>What is the registration fee?</small>
            <br />
            If you file online using eCO eService, the fee is $35 per
            application. Generally, each work requires a separate application.
            See Circular 4, Copyright Fees.
            <br />
            <small>Do you take credit cards?</small>
            <br />
            If you file your application online using eCO eService, you may pay
            by credit card. Credit cards are not accepted for registration
            through the mail, but may be used for registrations that are filed
            in person in the Copyright Office. There are other services for
            which the Copyright Office will accept a credit card payment. For
            more information see Circular 4, Copyright Fees
            <br />
            <small>Do I have to send in my work? Do I get it back?</small>
            <br />
            Yes, you must send the required copy or copies of the work to be
            registered. Your copies will not be returned. If you register online
            using eCO eService, you may attach an electronic copy of your
            deposit. However, even if you register online, if the Library of
            Congress requires a hard-copy deposit of your work, you must send
            what the Library defines as the "best edition" of your work. For
            further information, see Circular 7b, Best Edition of Published
            Copyrighted Works for the Collection of the Library of Congress, and
            Circular 7d, Mandatory Deposit of Copies or Phonorecords for the
            Library of Congress. Upon their deposit in the Copyright Office,
            under sections 407 and 408 of the copyright law, all copies and
            identifying material, including those deposited in connection with
            claims that have been refused registration, are the property of the
            U.S. government.
            <br />
            <small>
              Will my deposit be damaged by security measures in place on
              Capitol Hill?
            </small>
            <br />
            To avoid damage to your hard-copy deposit caused by necessary
            security measures, package the following items in boxes rather than
            envelopes for mailing to the Copyright Office:
            <ul>
              <li>
                electronic media such as audiocassettes, videocassettes, CDs,
                and DVDs
              </li>
              <li>microform</li>
              <li>photographs</li>
              <li>
                slick advertisements, color photocopies, and other print items
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <small>
              May I register more than one work on the same application? Where
              do I list the titles?
            </small>
            <br />
            You may register unpublished works as a collection on one
            application with one title for the entire collection if certain
            conditions are met. Published works may only be registered as a
            collection if they were actually first published as a collection and
            if other requirements have been met. See Circular 1, Copyright
            Basics, section “Registration Procedures.”
            <br />
            <small>
              Do I have to use my real name on the form? Can I use a stage name
              or a pen name?
            </small>
            <br />
            There is no legal requirement that the author be identified by his
            or her real name on the application form. For further information,
            see FL 101, Pseudonyms. If filing under a fictitious name, check the
            “Pseudonymous” box when giving information about the authors.
            <br />
            <small>
              Will my personal information be available to the public?
            </small>
            <br />
            Yes. Please be aware that when you register your claim to a
            copyright in a work with the U.S. Copyright Office, you are making a
            public record. All the information you provide on your copyright
            registration is available to the public and will be available on the
            Internet.
            <br />
            <small>
              How long does the registration process take, and when will I
              receive my certificate?
            </small>
            <br />
            The time the Copyright Office requires to process an application
            varies, depending on the number of applications the Office is
            receiving and clearing at the time of submission and the extent of
            questions associated with the application. Current Processing Times
            <br />
            <small>Can I submit my manuscript on a computer disk?</small>
            <br />
            No. Floppy disks and other removal media such as Zip disks, except
            for CD-ROMs, are not acceptable. Therefore, the Copyright Office
            still generally requires a printed copy or audio recording of the
            work for deposit. However, if you register online using eCO
            eService, you may attach an electronic copy of your deposit.
            However, even if you register online, if the Library of Congress
            requires a hard-copy deposit of your work, you must send what the
            Library defines as the "best edition" of your work. For further
            information, see Circular 7b, Best Edition of Published Copyrighted
            Works for the Collection of the Library of Congress, and Circular
            7d, Mandatory Deposit of Copies or Phonorecords for the Library of
            Congress.
            <br />
            <small>Can I submit a CD-ROM of my work?</small>
            <br />
            Yes. The deposit requirement consists of the best edition of the
            CD-ROM package of any work, including the accompanying operating
            software, instruction manual, and a printed version, if included in
            the package.
            <br />
            <small>Does my work have to be published to be protected?</small>
            <br />
            Publication is not necessary for copyright protection.
            <br />
            <small>
              How much do I have to change in my own work to make a new claim of
              copyright?
            </small>
            <br />
            You may make a new claim in your work if the changes are substantial
            and creative, something more than just editorial changes or minor
            changes. This would qualify as a new derivative work. For instance,
            simply making spelling corrections throughout a work does not
            warrant a new registration, but adding an additional chapter would.
            See Circular 14, Copyright Registration for Derivative Works, for
            further information.
            <br />
            <small>Do you have special mailing requirements?</small>
            <br />
            If you register online, you may attach an electronic copy of your
            deposit unless a hard-copy deposit is required under the "Best
            Edition" requirements of the Library of Congress. See Circular 7b.
            If you file using a paper application, our only requirement is that
            all three elements—the application, the copy or copies of the work,
            and the filing fee—be sent in the same package. Please limit any
            individual box to 20 pounds. Many people send their material to us
            by certified mail, with a return receipt request, but this is not
            required.
          </p>
          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            <small>Can I see my copyright registration records?</small>
            <br />
            Yes. The Copyright Office is required by law to maintain records of
            copyright registrations and to make them available for public
            inspection. Once a registration is completed and a claim has been
            cataloged, it becomes part of the public record. Individuals have
            always been able to come to the Copyright Office to inspect its
            public records. Information in post-1978 registration records is
            also available on the Copyright Office’s website.
            <br />
            <small>
              Will my registration records help provide contact information for
              someone interested in using my work?
            </small>
            <br />
            Yes. Records of copyright registrations and documents that are
            recorded in relationship to them can be used by the public to
            identify the author(s) and copyright owner(s) of a work. The public
            record may also provide information about an agent of the owner who
            can be contacted to license the registered work or to request
            permission to use it.
            <br />
            <small>
              Can I remove information that I don't want publicized?
            </small>
            <br />
            No. When you register a claim to copyright in a work with the
            Copyright Office, you create a public record of your claim to
            copyright. This record cannot be removed from the public record once
            it has been entered. All information you provide on your copyright
            registration will be available to the public and some of it on the
            Internet. You may wish to consider whether you want to include a
            birth date, nickname, alias, or any other optional detail you
            consider to be sensitive on your application.
            <br />
            <small>Sample Catalog Records</small>
            <br />
            The sample catalog records below show the information from copyright
            applications that is typically displayed in the Copyright Office
            online database. Highlighting is added to show certain personal
            information that may appear in the record.
            <br />
            <small>
              How can I prevent personal information from being placed on the
              Copyright Office's website?
            </small>
            <br />
            All information provided on the application for registration will
            become a permanent part of the public record of the Copyright
            Office, and some of that information will be available online
            through the Office’s website, including the name and address of the
            copyright claimant. Any information provided in the rights and
            permissions section of the application will also be made available
            online, but providing rights and permissions information is
            optional. Applicants who want to include rights and permissions
            information but do not want to provide personal details can use
            third-party agents, post office boxes, or designated email accounts.
            If someone else submits an application on your behalf, it is still
            your responsibility to ensure that information that you want to keep
            out of the public record is omitted. In certain cases, it may be
            permissible to register a claim in a work either anonymously or
            pseudonymously (under a fictitious name). Other categories of
            information in copyright applications that may be made available
            online include the following: type of work, registration number,
            title of the work, author, authorship, preexisting material date of
            creation, date of publication.
            <br />
            <small>
              Why is my copyright registration information now appearing on
              search engines such as Google?
            </small>
            <br />
            Because your copyright registration is a public record, others can
            access it and may create alternative means to make the information
            in it more widely available. The Copyright Office is not responsible
            for the form or the substance of third-party redistribution of
            Copyright Office records.
          </p>
          <h3>Preregistration</h3>
          <p>
            <small>How do I complete a preregistration application?</small>
            <br />
            The preregistration application is only available online. We
            recommend that you read the detailed information by clicking here,
            including the screen-by-screen instructions, before beginning your
            online application. Much of this information is also provided on the
            individual application screens. To begin the preregistration
            process, go to the Preregister Your Work page and click on the Start
            the Preregistration Process button at the bottom of the page.
            <br />
            <small>
              You ask for a description in the preregistration application. What
              should it include?
            </small>
            <br />
            Your description should be sufficient to reasonably identify the
            work but should consist of no more than 2,000 characters
            (approximately 330 words). It need not be detailed and need not
            include confidential information. This description will be made part
            of the online public record. (See specific help about the
            description).
            <br />
            <small>Will I receive a certificate for my preregistration?</small>
            <br />
            No. When the Copyright Office completes your preregistration, we
            will send you an official notification email containing the
            information from your application, and the preregistration number
            and date. This same information will also appear in the Copyright
            Office permanent online catalog record of the preregistration. A
            certified copy of the official notification may be obtained from the
            Certifications and Documents Section of the Copyright Office
          </p>
          <h3>Preregistration Payment</h3>
          <p>
            <small>What is the fee for preregistration?</small>
            <br />
            $115 nonrefundable filing fee per application. NOTE: The filing fee
            will not be refunded whether or not the preregistration is
            ultimately made.
            <br />
            <small>
              What methods of payment are accepted for preregistration?
            </small>
            <br />
            You may pay the nonrefundable filing fee for your submission(s) with
            a credit card, by ACH, or by debiting your existing Copyright Office
            Deposit Account.
            <br />
            <small>What does ACH (payment) mean? </small>
            <br />
            ACH is an acronym for The Automated Clearing House Network. If you
            choose this option of payment, you may have money transferred
            electronically from your personal or corporate bank account to make
            your payment to the Copyright Office. If you choose this method, you
            will need your bank’s routing number and your bank account number.
            These usually appear on your check; the routing number is sometimes
            the one appearing at the bottom left on your check, with your check
            account number appearing to the right of the routing number. You may
            give a check number on the online payment screen, but it is not
            required.
          </p>

          <h3>Password</h3>
          <p>
            <small>
              Do I receive a password from the Copyright Office to log into the
              eCO website to preregister my work? Or do I create my own
              password?
            </small>
            <br />
            The Copyright Office doesn’t issue you a password unless you forget
            one you have already established when you create your New User
            profile. (In that case, you are issued a temporary password, which
            you should change to your own password immediately.)
            <br />
            <small>
              What methods of payment are accepted for preregistration?
            </small>
            <br />
            You may pay the nonrefundable filing fee for your submission(s) with
            a credit card, by ACH, or by debiting your existing Copyright Office
            Deposit Account.
            <br />
            <small>
              What are the password requirements that I should follow when I
              create my password?
            </small>
            <br />
            A password should consist of:
            <br />
            a minimum of 8 characters
            <br />
            at least two alphabetic characters
            <br />
            at least 1 numeric and 1 special character (e.g., @ * &)
            <br />
            no consecutive repeated characters
            <br />
            It may NOT include
            <br />
            your user name or any part thereof the names of a spouse, children,
            pets, or one’s own name regional sports teams or players any office
            symbols your social security number or any subset of your social
            security number that is more than a single number words that can be
            found in any dictionary, whether English language or any language
            <br />
            <small>How do I change my password?</small>
            <br />
            Select My Profile from the top menu bar
            <br />
            Select User Profile by clicking on the link. Click on the Change
            Password button that appears at the top of the User Profile.
            <br />
            Enter your current password in the designated field, then enter your
            new password. You will need to give the new password again so that
            if you have made a typographical error, the computer system will
            find the error and ask you to re-enter the password in the two
            fields again. Click Save to save your new password.
            <br />
            <small>What do I do if I forgot my password?</small>
            <br />

          <h3>What Form Do I Fill Out to Register my Copyright?</h3>
          <p>
            Online registration through the electronic Copyright Office (eCO) is
            the preferred way to register basic claims.
            <br />
            Paper versions of Form TX (literary works); Form VA (visual arts
            works); Form PA (perform arts); Form SR (sound recordings) are
            available on the Copyright Office website. Staff will send them to
            you by postal mail upon COP request. Remember that online
            registration through eCO can be used for these types of
            applications.

              I have several copyrights on file with the Copyright Office, and
              have moved since submitting those applications. Is there a form to
              submit to change the address on my applications?
            </small>
            <br />
            Although there is no statutory requirement to notify the Copyright
            Office of a change of address, you may wish to have our records
            reflect such information. There are several ways to do this: 1) You
            may file a document listing all your registered works by title and
            registration number, along with your new address. Your current
            address will then be included in our records and be available to
            those who search the documents file. However, the original
            registration records are not changed. See Circular 12, Recordation
            of Transfers and Other Documents, for more information. 2) You may
            file a supplementary registration Form CA to amend a completed
            registration to indicate the new address. If you have multiple
            registrations, filing a Form CA only on the most recent registration
            will effectively get your new address on record. See Circular 8,
            Supplementary Copyright Registration, for more information. 3)
            Finally, filing a registration for a new work in the future will
            also effectively get your new address on record. For more
            information on fees, please refer to Circular 4.

            <br />
            If you apply for copyright registration online, you will receive an
            email stating that your application has been received. Otherwise,
            the Copyright Office does not provide a confirmation of receipt.
            Currently, if you use a commercial carrier (such as Federal Express,
            Airborne Express, DHL Worldwide Express, or United Parcel Service),
            that company may be able to provide an acknowledgment of receipt by
            the Copyright Office. Due to the mail disruption, an acknowledgment
            of receipt for mail sent via the U.S. Postal Service, e.g.,
            certified, registered and overnight delivery, may take several weeks
            or longer to receive. Claims to copyright may also be hand-delivered
            to the Copyright Office. See About the Office for hours and
            location.

            The time the Copyright Office requires to process an application
            varies, depending on the number of applications the Office is
            receiving and clearing at the time of submission and the extent of
            questions associated with the application. Current processing times
            are:
            <br />
            Processing Time for e-Filing: generally, 3 to 5 months
            <br />
            Processing Time for Paper Forms: generally, 7 to 13 months
            <br />
            Note: For works that are determined to be copyrightable and that
            meet all legal and procedural requirements for registration, the
            effective date of registration is the date the Copyright Office
            received the completed application, correct payment, and copy(ies)
            of the work being registered in acceptable form. You do not need to
            wait for a certificate to proceed with publication.

              I’ve been getting solicitation letters from publishers. Is the
              Copyright Office selling my personal information?
            </small>
            <br />
            The Copyright Office does not sell information. Copyright Office
            records, however, are public records, which means anyone may come to
            our office and inspect them. Occasionally organizations such as
            music publishers or book publishers send a representative to the
            Copyright Office to compile lists of names and addresses of those
            authors who have most recently registered their works. Their
            purpose, undoubtedly, is to solicit new business. This practice is
            not a violation of the law.

          <h3>How Long Does Copyright Protection Last?</h3>
          <p>
            <small>How long does a copyright last?</small>
            <br />
            The term of copyright for a particular work depends on several
            factors, including whether it has been published, and, if so, the
            date of first publication. As a general rule, for works created
            after January 1, 1978, copyright protection lasts for the life of
            the author plus an additional 70 years. For an anonymous work, a
            pseudonymous work, or a work made for hire, the copyright endures
            for a term of 95 years from the year of its first publication or a
            term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires
            first. For works first published prior to 1978, the term will vary
            depending on several factors. To determine the length of copyright
            protection for a particular work, consult chapter 3 of the Copyright
            Act (title 17 of the United States Code). More information on the
            term of copyright can be found in Circular 15a, Duration of
            Copyright, and Circular 1, Copyright Basics.
            <br />
            <small>Do I have to renew my copyright?</small>
            <br />
            No. Works created on or after January 1, 1978, are not subject to
            renewal registration. As to works published or registered prior to
            January 1, 1978, renewal registration is optional after 28 years but
            does provide certain legal advantages. For information on how to
            file a renewal application as well as the legal benefit for doing
            so, see Circular 15, Renewal of Copyright, and Circular 15a,
            Duration of Copyright.

          <h3>Can I Use Someone Else’s Work? Can Someone Else Use Mine</h3>
          <p>
            <small>How do I get permission to use somebody else's work?</small>
            <br />
            You can ask for it. If you know who the copyright owner is, you may
            contact the owner directly. If you are not certain about the
            ownership or have other related questions, you may wish to request
            that the Copyright Office conduct a search of its records or you may
            search yourself. See the next question for more details.
            <br />
            <small>How can I find out who owns a copyright?</small>
            <br />
            We can provide you with the information available in our records. A
            search of registrations, renewals, and recorded transfers of
            ownership made before 1978 requires a manual search of our files.
            Upon request, our staff will search our records at the statutory
            rate of $165 for each hour (2 hour minimum). There is no fee if you
            conduct a search in person at the Copyright Office. Copyright
            registrations made and documents recorded from 1978 to date are
            available for searching online. For further information, see
            Circular 22, How to Investigate the Copyright Status of a Work, and
            Circular 23, Copyright Card Catalog and the Online File.

              How can I obtain copies of someone else's work and/or registration
              certificate?
            </small>
            <br />
            The Copyright Office will not honor a request for a copy of someone
            else's protected work without written authorization from the
            copyright owner or from his or her designated agent, unless the work
            is involved in litigation. In the latter case, a litigation
            statement is required. A certificate of registration for any
            registered work can be obtained for a fee of $35. Circular 6, Access
            to and Copies of Copyright Records and Deposit, provides additional
            information.

              How much of someone else's work can I use without getting
              permission?
            </small>
            <br />
            Under the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is
            permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for
            purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and
            scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a
            specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or
            percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use
            depends on all the circumstances. See FL 102, Fair Use, and Circular
            21, Reproductions of Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians.

              How much do I have to change in order to claim copyright in
              someone else's work?
            </small>
            <br />
            Only the owner of copyright in a work has the right to prepare, or
            to authorize someone else to create, a new version of that work.
            Accordingly, you cannot claim copyright to another's work, no matter
            how much you change it, unless you have the owner's consent. See
            Circular 14, Copyright Registration for Derivative Works.
            <br />
            <small>Somebody infringed my copyright. What can I do?</small>
            <br />
            A party may seek to protect his or her copyrights against
            unauthorized use by filing a civil lawsuit in federal district
            court. If you believe that your copyright has been infringed,
            consult an attorney. In cases of willful infringement for profit,
            the U.S. Attorney may initiate a criminal investigation.
            <br />
            <small>
              Could I be sued for using somebody else's work? How about quotes
              or samples?{" "}
            </small>
            <br />
            If you use a copyrighted work without authorization, the owner may
            be entitled to bring an infringement action against you. There are
            circumstances under the fair use doctrine where a quote or a sample
            may be used without permission. However, in cases of doubt, the
            Copyright Office recommends that permission be obtained.

            <small>
              Do you have a list of songs or movies in the public domain?
            </small>
            <br />
            No, we neither compile nor maintain such a list. A search of our
            records, however, may reveal whether a particular work has fallen
            into the public domain. We will conduct a search of our records by
            the title of a work, an author's name, or a claimant's name. Upon
            request, our staff will search our records at the statutory rate of
            $165 for each hour (2 hour minimum). You may also search the records
            in person without paying a fee.

              I saw an image on the Library of Congress website that I would
              like to use. Do I need to obtain permission?
            </small>
            <br />
            With few exceptions, the Library of Congress does not own copyright
            in the materials in its collections and does not grant or deny
            permission to use the content mounted on its website. Responsibility
            for making an independent legal assessment of an item from the
            Library’s collections and for securing any necessary permissions
            rests with persons desiring to use the item. To the greatest extent
            possible, the Library attempts to provide any known rights
            information about its collections. Such information can be found in
            the “Copyright and Other Restrictions” statements on each American
            Memory online collection homepage. If the image is not part of the
            American Memory collections, contact the Library custodial division
            to which the image is credited. Bibliographic records and finding
            aids available in each custodial division include information that
            may assist in assessing the copyright status. Search our catalogs
            through the Library's Online Catalog. To access information from the
            Library’s reading rooms, go to Research Centers.

              Is it legal to download works from peer-to-peer networks and if
              not, what is the penalty for doing so?
            </small>
            <br />
            Uploading or downloading works protected by copyright without the
            authority of the copyright owner is an infringement of the copyright
            owner's exclusive rights of reproduction and/or distribution. Anyone
            found to have infringed a copyrighted work may be liable for
            statutory damages up to $30,000 for each work infringed and, if
            willful infringement is proven by the copyright owner, that amount
            may be increased up to $150,000 for each work infringed. In
            addition, an infringer of a work may also be liable for the
            attorney's fees incurred by the copyright owner to enforce his or
            her rights.
            <br />
            Whether or not a particular work is being made available under the
            authority of the copyright owner is a question of fact. But since
            any original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium
            (including a computer file) is protected by federal copyright law
            upon creation, in the absence of clear information to the contrary,
            most works may be assumed to be protected by federal copyright law.
            <br />
            Since the files distributed over peer-to-peer networks are primarily
            copyrighted works, there is a risk of liability for downloading
            material from these networks. To avoid these risks, there are
            currently many "authorized" services on the Internet that allow
            consumers to purchase copyrighted works online, whether music,
            ebooks, or motion pictures. By purchasing works through authorized
            services, consumers can avoid the risks of infringement liability
            and can limit their exposure to other potential risks, e.g.,
            viruses, unexpected material, or spyware.
            <br />

            testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

              Can a school show a movie without obtaining permission from the
              copyright owner?
            </small>
            <br />
            If the movie is for entertainment purposes, you need to get a
            clearance or license for its performance.
            <br />
            It is not necessary to obtain permission if you show the movie in
            the course of “face-to-face teaching activities” in a nonprofit
            educational institution, in a classroom or similar place devoted to
            instruction, if the copy of the movie being performed is a lawful
            copy. 17 U.S.C. § 110(1). This exemption encompasses instructional
            activities relating to a wide variety of subjects, but it does not
            include performances for recreation or entertainment purposes , even
            if there is cultural value or intellectual appeal.

            Questions regarding this provision of the copyright law should be

              My local copying store will not make reproductions of old family
              photographs. What can I do?
            </small>
            <br />
            Photocopying shops, photography stores and other photo developing
            stores are often reluctant to make reproductions of old photographs
            for fear of violating the copyright law and being sued. These fears
            are not unreasonable, because copy shops have been sued for
            reproducing copyrighted works and have been required to pay
            substantial damages for infringing copyrighted works. The policy
            established by a shop is a business decision and risk assessment
            that the business is entitled to make, because the business may face
            liability if they reproduce a work even if they did not know the
            work was copyrighted.
            <br />
            In the case of photographs, it is sometimes difficult to determine
            who owns the copyright and there may be little or no information
            about the owner on individual copies. Ownership of a “copy” of a
            photograph – the tangible embodiment of the “work” – is distinct
            from the “work” itself – the intangible intellectual property. The
            owner of the “work” is generally the photographer or, in certain
            situations, the employer of the photographer. Even if a person hires
            a photographer to take pictures of a wedding, for example, the
            photographer will own the copyright in the photographs unless the
            copyright in the photographs is transferred, in writing and signed
            by the copyright owner, to another person. The subject of the
            photograph generally has nothing to do with the ownership of the
            copyright in the photograph. If the photographer is no longer
            living, the rights in the photograph are determined by the
            photographer’s will or passed as personal property by the applicable
            laws of intestate succession.
            <br />
            There may be situations in which the reproduction of a photograph
            may be a “fair use” under the copyright law. Information about fair
            use may be found at:
            <Link to="/">www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html </Link>. However, even
            if a person determines a use to be a “fair use” under the factors of
            section 107 of the Copyright Act, a copy shop or other third party
            need not accept the person’s assertion that the use is
            noninfringing. Ultimately, only a federal court can determine
            whether a particular use is, in fact, a fair use under the law.

          <h3>Assignment/ Transfer of Copyright Ownership</h3>
          <p>
            <small>Are copyrights transferable?</small>
            <br />
            Yes. Like any other property, all or part of the rights in a work
            may be transferred by the owner to another. See Circular 1,
            Copyright Basics, section "Transfer of Copyright," for a discussion
            of ownership.
            <br />
            <small>Do you have any forms for transfer of copyrights?</small>
            <br />
            There are no forms provided by the Copyright Office to effect a
            copyright transfer. The Office does, however, keep records of
            transfers if they are submitted to us. If you have executed a
            transfer and wish to record the document, see Circular 12,
            Recordations of Transfers and Other Documents, for detailed
            instructions.
          </p>

          <h3>Copyright and Digital Files</h3>
          <p>
            <small>Can I backup my computer software?</small>
            <br />
            Yes, under certain conditions as provided by section 117 of the
            Copyright Act. Although the precise term used under section 117 is
            “archival” copy, not “backup” copy, these terms today are used
            interchangeably. This privilege extends only to computer programs
            and not to other types of works.
            <br />
            the new copy is being made for archival (i.e., backup) purposes
            only; you are the legal owner of the copy; and any copy made for
            archival purposes is either destroyed, or transferred with the
            original copy, once the original copy is sold, given away, or
            otherwise transferred. You are not permitted under section 117 to
            make a backup copy of other material on a computer's hard drive,
            such as other copyrighted works that have been downloaded (e.g.,
            music, films).
            <br />
            Under section 117, you or someone you authorize may make a copy of
            an original computer program if:
            <br />
            It is also important to check the terms of sale or license agreement
            of the original copy of software in case any special conditions have
            been put in place by the copyright owner that might affect your
            ability or right under section 117 to make a backup copy. There is
            no other provision in the Copyright Act that specifically authorizes
            the making of backup copies of works other than computer programs
            even if those works are distributed as digital copies.
            <br />
            <small>
              Is it legal to sell backup copies of computer software (in online
              auctions or on website)? Is it legal to buy and use a backup copy
              of software I already own?
            </small>
            <br />
            No. The Copyright Act does not permit anyone to sell backup copies
            to third parties separately from the original copy of the software.
            If you lawfully own a computer program, you may sell or transfer
            that lawful copy together with a lawfully made backup copy of the
            software, but you may not sell the backup copy alone.
            <br />
            We have been made aware of websites that are offering to sell
            “backup” copies of software via download over the Internet or in a
            custom-burned CD-R format, under the guise that section 117 permits
            this. Section 117 does NOT permit the sale of backup copies. Again,
            section 117 does not allow you to sell backup copies to someone else
            except when such backup copies are sold together with the original
            lawfully owned copy. It does not allow anyone to solely distribute
            “backup” copies to the public. In addition to being a violation of
            the exclusive right of distribution, such activity is also likely to
            be a violation of the terms of the license to the software. In many
            cases these sites appear to be a front for distribution of illegal
            copies, which is copyright infringement. You should be wary of sites
            that offer to sell you a backup copy.
            <br />
            And if you do buy an illegal backup copy, you will be engaging in
            copyright infringement if you load that illegal copy onto your
            computer, i.e., the unauthorized reproduction of the infringing
            computer program into memory. Lesson: if you want a backup copy of a
            lawfully owned computer program, back it up yourself.
            <br />
            <small>Can I copyright my website?</small>
            <br />
            The original authorship appearing on a website may be protected by
            copyright. This includes writings, artwork, photographs, and other
            forms of authorship protected by copyright. Procedures for
            registering the contents of a website may be found in Circular 66,
            Copyright Registration for Online Works.
            <br />
            <small>Can I copyright my domain name?</small>
            <br />
            Copyright law does not protect domain names. The Internet
            Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a nonprofit
            organization that has assumed the responsibility for domain name
            system management, administers the assignation of domain names
            through accredited registers.
            <br />
            <small>
              Is it legal to download works from peer-to-peer networks and if
              not, what is the penalty for doing so?
            </small>
            <br />
            Uploading or downloading works protected by copyright without the
            authority of the copyright owner is an infringement of the copyright
            owner's exclusive rights of reproduction and/or distribution. Anyone
            found to have infringed a copyrighted work may be liable for
            statutory damages up to $30,000 for each work infringed and, if
            willful infringement is proven by the copyright owner, that amount
            may be increased up to $150,000 for each work infringed. In
            addition, an infringer of a work may also be liable for the
            attorney's fees incurred by the copyright owner to enforce his or
            her rights. Whether or not a particular work is being made available
            under the authority of the copyright owner is a question of fact.
            But since any original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium
            (including a computer file) is protected by federal copyright law
            upon creation, in the absence of clear information to the contrary,
            most works may be assumed to be protected by federal copyright law.
            Since the files distributed over peer-to-peer networks are primarily
            copyrighted works, there is a risk of liability for downloading
            material from these networks. To avoid these risks, there are
            currently many "authorized" services on the Internet that allow
            consumers to purchase copyrighted works online, whether music,
            ebooks, or motion pictures. By purchasing works through authorized
            services, consumers can avoid the risks of infringement liability
            and can limit their exposure to other potential risks, e.g.,
            viruses, unexpected material, or spyware. For more information on
            this issue, see the Register of Copyrights' testimony before the
            Senate Judiciary Committee.

          <h3>Services of the Copyright Office</h3>
          <p>
            <small>
              Are you the only place I can go to register a copyright?
            </small>
            <br />
            Yes. Although copyright application forms may be available in public
            libraries and some reference books, the U.S. Copyright Office is the
            only office that can accept applications and issue registrations.
            <br />
            <small>
              Can you provide me with copies of my application and my work?
            </small>
            <br />
            Contact the Records Research and Certifications Section of the
            Copyright Office at (202)707-6787 or see Circular 6, Access to and
            Copies of Copyright Records and Deposit, for details.
            <br />
            <small>I lost my certificate. Can I get a new one?</small>
            <br />
            Yes, we can produce an additional certificate for a fee of $35. See
            Circular 6, Access to and Copies of Copyright Records and Deposits,
            for details on how to make a request.
            <br />
            <small>Can you tell me who owns a copyright?</small>
            <br />
            We can provide you with the information available in our records. A
            search of registrations, renewals, and recorded transfers of
            ownership made before 1978 requires a manual search of our files.
            Upon request, our staff will search our records at the statutory
            rate of $165 for each hour (2 hour minimum). There is no fee if you
            conduct a search in person at the Copyright Office. Copyright
            registrations made and documents recorded from 1978 to date are
            available for searching online. For further information, see
            Circular 22, How to Investigate the Copyright Status of a Work, and
            Circular 23, Copyright Card Catalog and the Online File.
            <br />
            <small>Is the Copyright Office open to the public?</small>
            <br />
            Yes. Hours of service are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. eastern time,
            Monday through Friday, except federal holidays. Activities available
            in person include speaking with a Copyright Office staff member,
            requesting various services, and searching our card catalog.
            <br />
            <small>Does the Copyright Office give legal advice?</small>
            <br />
            No. The Copyright Office does not give legal opinions concerning the
            rights of persons in cases of alleged infringement, contracts, or
            the copyright status of any particular work other than the
            information shown in the records of the Office.
            <br />
            <small>How do I get my work published?</small>
            <br />
            Publication occurs at the discretion and initiative of the copyright
            owner. The Copyright Office has no role in the publication process.
            <br />
            <small>How do I collect royalties?</small>
            <br />
            The collection of royalties is usually a matter of private
            arrangements between an author and publisher or other users of the
            author's work. The Copyright Office plays no role in the execution
            of contractual terms or business practices. There are copyright
            licensing organizations and publications rights clearinghouses that
            distribute royalties for their members.
            <br />
            <small>How do I get my work into the Library of Congress?</small>
            <br />
            Copies of works deposited for copyright registration or in
            fulfillment of the mandatory deposit requirement are available to
            the Library of Congress for its collections. The Library reserves
            the right to select or reject any published work for its permanent
            collections based on the research needs of Congress, the nation's
            scholars, and the nation's libraries. If you would like further
            information on the Library's selection policies, you may contact:
            Library of Congress, Collections Policy Office, 101 Independence
            Avenue, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540.

          <h3>Mandatory Deposit</h3>
          <p>
            <small>What is mandatory deposit?</small>
            <br />
            Mandatory deposit (17 U.S.C. section 407) requires the owner of
            copyright or of the exclusive right of distribution to deposit in
            the U.S. Copyright Office for the use of the Library of Congress two
            complete copies of the best edition within 3 months after a work is
            published. Copies of all works under copyright protection that have
            been published or distributed in the United States must be deposited
            with the Copyright Office within 3 months of the date of first
            publication. (See Copyright Office Circular 7d, Mandatory Deposit of
            Copies or Phonorecords for the Library of Congress, and the Deposit
            Regulation 202.19.)
            <br />
            <small>
              We are a foreign publisher. Do we need to submit our publication
              to comply with the U.S. deposit requirement?
            </small>
            <br />
            Yes. If you distribute your work in the United States, you are
            subject to the deposit requirements of the United States. These
            requirements apply to a work that is first published in a foreign
            country as soon as that work is distributed in the United States
            through the distribution of copies that are either imported or are
            part of an American edition. The deposit requirement is one copy.
            <br />
            <small>
              What is the difference between mandatory deposit and copyright
              registration?
            </small>
            <br />
            Mandatory deposit (17 U.S.C. section 407) requires the owner of
            copyright or the exclusive right of distribution to deposit in the
            Copyright Office for the use of the Library of Congress two complete
            copies of the best edition within 3 months after a work is
            published. Section 408 of the copyright law, for a fee, provides the
            option to formally register the work with the U.S. Copyright Office.
            This registration process provides a legal record of copyright
            ownership as well as additional legal benefits in cases of
            infringement. Optional registration fulfills mandatory deposit
            requirements.

              Where do I send my published works to comply with mandatory
              deposit?

            <small>Is there an exception to mandatory deposits?</small>
            <br />
            Yes. Under certain circumstances, special relief from deposit
            requirements may be granted. The grant of special relief is
            discretionary with the U.S. Copyright Office and will depend on a
            careful balance of the acquisition policies of the Library of
            Congress, the examining requirements of the Copyright Office (if
            registration is sought), and the hardship to the copyright owner

            <small>How do I get my work into the Library of Congress?</small>
            <br />
            Requests must set forth specific reasons why special relief should
            be granted and must be signed by or on behalf of the owner of
            copyright or the owner of the exclusive right of distribution in the
            work. They would be sent as follows:

              If my publication does not have a copyright notice, do I still
              have to deposit?
            </small>
            <br />
            Yes. On March 1, 1989, the qualification "with notice of copyright"
            was eliminated from the mandatory deposit provision (Public Law
            100-568). As a result of this change, all works under copyright
            protection that are published in the United States on or after March
            1, 1989, are subject to mandatory deposit whether published with or
            without a notice.
            <br />
            <small>
              What is the difference between the mandatory deposit obligation
              and the Cataloging in Publication (CIP) obligation?
            </small>
            <br />
            Mandatory deposit is a legal obligation (17 U.S.C. section 407) and
            applies to all U.S. and foreign publishers distributing their works
            in the United States. A CIP obligation is limited to those
            publishers who have entered a contractual agreement with the Library
            of Congress. In exchange for the Library providing preliminary
            cataloging information to the publisher for works submitted to the
            CIP program, the publisher agrees to provide a copy of the
            publication to the Library of Congress.
            <br />
            <small>
              Will my Cataloging in Publication (CIP) copy fulfill my mandatory
              deposit obligation?
            </small>
            <br />
            No. CIP is a separate program within the Library of Congress that
            requires participating publishers to submit one copy of published
            works. The CIP is in addition to the two copies required for
            mandatory deposit.
            <br />
            <small>
              If I send deposit copies of a sample issue of my serial
              publication to the Register of Copyrights, have I fulfilled the
              deposit requirement with respect to my serial publication?
            </small>
            <br />
            No. For copyright purposes each serial issue is considered a
            separate work. You must deposit two copies of each issue within
            three months after the date of publication. If you do not intend to
            register, you may find it convenient to add the address of the
            Register of Copyrights to your mailing list so that two copies are
            automatically sent to the Copyright Office each time an issue is
            published.
            <br />
            <small>
              I have already deposited identifying material to register my
              computer software as described in Circular 61-Copyright
              Registration for Computer Programs. Why am I now being requested
              to send the actual software?
            </small>
            <br />
            As described in Circular 61, the deposit requirement for
            registration is one copy of identifying portions of the computer
            program. However, to satisfy the mandatory deposit under section
            407, a "complete copy" of the published work must be deposited. A
            complete copy is defined in the regulations as a copy that includes
            all components that make up the unit of publication, even if any of
            those units are in the public domain. So, if the published user
            guide is normally part of a package that contains other elements,
            then the mandatory deposit requirement requires the deposit of those
            other elements, too. For example, if the user guide is published as
            part of a package that contains a CD-ROM, an installation guide, and
            installation software, then each of these other elements must be
            deposited in addition to the user guide to fulfill the mandatory
            deposit requirement.

            <small>
              If the Library of Congress does not want to retain my newspaper in
              the microfilm collection, do I still need to submit a copy of the
              35mm silver positive to apply for the copyright registration?
            </small>
            <br />
            If the Library of Congress decides not to retain your microfilm in
            the newspaper microfilm collection, the Copyright Acquisitions
            Division (CAD) of the Copyright Office may exempt you from sending
            the microfilm. CAD will notify you if your newspaper is exempt.
            However, the Library reserves the right to reverse this decision. If
            the Library decides to retain your newspaper in the collection in
            the future, CAD will issue to your organization a request for the
            microfilm deposit.
            <br />
            <small>
              If the Library of Congress does not want to add our newspaper to
              its collection, can we still register our copyright with the
              Copyright Office?
            </small>
            <br />
            Yes. In this case, an optional deposit may accompany the
            application. This deposit should consist of (a) complete print
            copies of the first and last issues of the month; or (b) print
            copies of the first section of the first and last issues of the
            month; or (c) print copies of the first page of the first and last
            issues of the month. For more information about the optional
            deposit, you may contact the Copyright Literary Division at
            202-707-8250.

              What are the requirements for applying for the newspaper group
              registration?
            </small>
            <br />
            A group of newspaper issues may be registered on Form G/DN only if
            all the following conditions are met. (1) The newspaper is a daily
            newspaper. (2) The submission includes all issue dates within the
            calendar month within the same year. (3) The submission includes a
            complete month's issues in microfilm form, unless specifically
            exempted. (4) Each issue essentially must be an all-new collective
            work. (5) The work must be a work made for hire. (6) The author and
            copyright claimant must be the same person or organization. (7) The
            application Form G/DN must be filed within three months after the
            last publication date included in the group.
            <br />

              How do I register my daily newspaper through group registration?
            </small>
            <br />
            In a single package, send a completed and signed form G/DN, a
            deposit of a positive 35mm silver-halide microfilm that includes all
            issues within the calendar month, and a $80 filing fee to:

            <small>
              Since copyright protection exists when the work is created, is it
              necessary to apply for copyright registration for our newspaper?
              What are the benefits of copyright registration?
            </small>
            <br />
            Even though copyright protection is secured automatically upon
            creation, there are certain definite advantages to copyright
            registration. Registration establishes a public record of the
            copyright claim. Before an infringement suit may be filed in court,
            registration is necessary for works of U.S. origin. If made before
            or within five years of publication, registration establishes prima
            facie evidence in court of the validity of the copyright and of the
            facts stated in the certificate. If registration is made within
            three months after publication of the work or prior to an
            infringement of the work, statutory damages and attorney's fees will
            be available to the copyright owner in court actions. Also,
            registration allows the owner of the copyright to record the
            registration with the U.S. Customs Service for protection against
            importation of infringing copies.

          <h3>Definitions</h3>
          <p>
            <small>Who is an author?</small>
            <br />
            Under the copyright law, the creator of the original expression in a
            work is its author. The author is also the owner of copyright unless
            there is a written agreement by which the author assigns the
            copyright to another person or entity, such as a publisher. In cases
            of works made for hire, the employer or commissioning party is
            considered to be the author. See Circular 9, Work-Made-For-Hire
            Under the 1976 Copyright Act.
            <br />
            <small>What is a deposit?</small>
            <br />
            A deposit is usually one copy (if unpublished) or two copies (if
            published) of the work to be registered for copyright. In certain
            cases such as works of the visual arts, identifying material such as
            a photograph may be used instead. See Circular 40a, Deposit
            Requirements for Registration of Claims to Copyright in Visual Arts
            Material. The deposit is sent with the application and fee and
            becomes the property of the Library of Congress.
            <br />
            <small>What is publication?</small>
            <br />
            Publication has a technical meaning in copyright law. According to
            the statute, “Publication is the distribution of copies or
            phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of
            ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending. The offering to
            distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes
            of further distribution, public performance, or public display
            constitutes publication. A public performance or display of a work
            does not of itself constitute publication.” Generally, publication
            occurs on the date on which copies of the work are first distributed
            to the public. For further information see Circular 1, Copyright
            Basics, section “Publication.”
            <br />
            <small>
              What is a copyright notice? How do I put a copyright notice on my
              work?
            </small>
            <br />
            A copyright notice is an identifier placed on copies of the work to
            inform the world of copyright ownership. The copyright notice
            generally consists of the symbol or word “copyright (or copr.),” the
            name of the copyright owner, and the year of first publication,
            e.g., ©2008 John Doe. While use of a copyright notice was once
            required as a condition of copyright protection, it is now optional.
            Use of the notice is the responsibility of the copyright owner and
            does not require advance permission from, or registration with, the
            Copyright Office. See Circular 3, Copyright Notice, for requirements
            for works published before March 1, 1989, and for more information
            on the form and position of the copyright notice.
            <br />
            <small>What is copyright infringement?</small>
            <br />
            As a general matter, copyright infringement occurs when a
            copyrighted work is reproduced, distributed, performed, publicly
            displayed, or made into a derivative work without the permission of
            the copyright owner.
            <br />
            <small>What is peer-to-peer (P2P) networking?</small>
            <br />
            A type of network where computers communicate directly with each
            other, rather than through a central server. Often referred to
            simply as peer-to-peer, or abbreviated P2P, a type of network in
            which each workstation has equivalent capabilities and
            responsibilities in contrast to client/server architectures, in
            which some computers are dedicated to serving the other computers. A
            "network" is a group of two or more computer systems linked together
            by various methods. In recent usage, peer-to-peer has come to
            describe applications in which users can use the Internet to
            exchange files with each other directly or through a mediating
            server.
            <br />
            <small>Where is the public domain?</small>
            <br />
            The public domain is not a place. A work of authorship is in the
            “public domain” if it is no longer under copyright protection or if
            it failed to meet the requirements for copyright protection. Works
            in the public domain may be used freely without the permission of
            the former copyright owner.
            <br />
            <small>What is mandatory deposit?</small>
            <br />
            Copies of all works under copyright protection that have been
            published in the United States are required to be deposited with the
            Copyright Office within three months of the date of first
            publication. See Circular 7d, Mandatory Deposit of Copies or
            Phonorecords for the Library of Congress, and the Deposit Regulation
            202.19.
            <br />
            <small>What is a work made for hire?</small>
            <br />
            Although the general rule is that the person who creates the work is
            its author, there is an exception to that principle. The exception
            is a work made for hire, which is a work prepared by an employee
            within the scope of his or her employment or a work specially
            ordered or commissioned in certain specified circumstances. When a
            work qualifies as a work made for hire, the employer, or
            commissioning party, is considered to be the author. See Circular 9,
            Work-Made-For-Hire Under the 1976 Copyright Act.
            <br />
            <small>What is a Library of Congress number?</small>
            <br />
            The Library of Congress Control Number is assigned by the Library at
            its discretion to assist librarians in acquiring and cataloging
            works. For further information, go to the Cataloging in Publication
            program website at<Link to="/">www.loc.gov/publish/cip/</Link>

            <br />
            <small>What is an ISBN number?</small>
            <br />
            The International Standard Book Number is administered by the R.R.
            Bowker Company. The ISBN is a numerical identifier intended to
            assist the international community in identifying and ordering
            certain publications.

          <h3>Special Handing FAQs</h3>
          <p>
            <small>What is special handling?</small>
            <br />
            Special handling is the expedited processing of an online or paper
            application for registration of a claim to copyright or for the
            recordation of a document pertaining to copyright. It is granted in
            certain circumstances to those who have compelling reasons for this
            service. It is subject to the approval of the chief of the Receipt
            Analysis and Control Division, who must consider the workload of the
            Copyright Office at the time the request is made.
            <br />
            <small>When is special handling granted?</small>
            <br />
            Special handling is granted only in the following specific
            circumstances:
            <br />
            pending or prospective litigation
            <br />
            customs matters, or
            <br />
            contract or publishing deadlines that necessitate the expedited
            issuance of a certificate. A cover letter explaining the
            circumstances for the request is sufficient
            <br />
            Note: Special handling is not available for requests to reconsider a
            refusal to register.
